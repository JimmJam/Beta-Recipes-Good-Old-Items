      <summary><h2>Beta Recipes</h2></summary>
        Beta Recipes emoves all recipes from the game, and only adds back those that were in Beta 1.7.3. This in combination with the other datpacks, Nostalgic Tweaks, Fabrication and Cabbage's Retro Generator can be used to recreate an almost 1 for 1 Beta 1.7.3 experience. Almost entirely made by prxvatescrxpts.

      <summary><h2>Only Cod</h2></summary>
        Makes the fishing loot tables only contain Cod, or "Raw Fish", as Good Old Names corrects. Removes all junk and treasure loot from the loot tables, effectively removing any chance of getting a modern item like an enchanted fishing rod, armor, or enchanted books.

      <summary><h2>No Mutton</h2></summary>
        Throughout Beta 1.7.3 and Release 1.7, sheep could be killed to drop 1 wool, but did not drop mutton because it had yet to be added. This datapack reverts to that behavior. Only made because the current "old drops" for sheep in Nostalgic Tweaks does not drop wool when sheep are killed.

      <summary><h2>Old Block Drops</h2></summary>
        In almost all Beta versions, there were certain drops that were different to modern versions. Currently, this datapack only changes oak stairs to drop one oak plank, cobblestone stairs to one cobblestone, and bookshelves to drop nothing (balanced by Beta Recipes, because of how cheap books were.) M16 also inspired me to remove the sick and apple drops from leaves. If you remember anything else that was different, let me know!

      <summary><h2>Good Old Names</h2></summary>
        Adds back and replaces lot of old names, renaming all wood types to "wood", wood type fences to "wood", and much more. Golden Days fixes almost all the rest of the names that aren't included in this pack. Not all names are directly from 1.7.3 - crafting table is "Workbench", as it was through b1.0-b1.2.

      <summary><h2>Indev and Beta Doors</h2></summary>
        During Indev, the side door texture was the same as the oak plank texture. This first pack brings this look back. The second, Beta doors had a weird look to them, where the top and bottom of the side of the door was a copy of the bottom front texture of the door, rather than the side of each the top and bottom.

      <summary><h2>No Grass Side</h2></summary>
        Throughout Alpha 1.2 and Beta 1.4, the grass top had humidity-specific colors, yet did not have an overlay on the side, making the grass side texture always look like the classic alpha texture. This pack reverts it to this look.
