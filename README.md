  <summary><h2>Beta Recipes</h2></summary>
    Beta Recipes emoves all recipes from the game, and only adds back those that were in Beta 1.7.3. This in combination with the other datpacks, Nostalgic Tweaks, Fabrication and Cabbage's Retro Generator can be used to recreate an almost 1 for 1 Beta 1.7.3 experience.

  <summary><h2>Good Old Names</h2></summary>
    Adds back and replaces lot of old names, renaming all wood types to "wood", wood type fences to "wood", and much more. Golden Days fixes almost all the rest of the names that aren't included in this pack. Not all names are directly from 1.7.3 - crafting table is "Workbench", as it was through b1.0-b1.2.

  <summary><h2>Only Cod</h2></summary>
    Makes the fishing loot tables only contain Cod, or "Raw Fish", as Good Old Names corrects. Removes all junk and treasure loot from the loot tables, effectively nerfing the modern fish farm.

  <summary><h2>No Mutton</h2></summary>
    Throughout Beta 1.7.3 and Release 1.7, sheep could be killed to drop 1 wool, but did not drop mutton because it had yet to be added. This datapack reverts to that behavior.

### Usage
<p>Feel free to use any of these datapacks on a server or a modpack! It would be greatly appreciated if some link is made back to this page for credit, though! Special exception to Adrenix if he would find any use of these to include in Nostalgic Tweaks teehee
